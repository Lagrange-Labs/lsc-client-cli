<!--
Key Principles
•  Human-Friendly: Changelogs are written for humans, not machines.

•  Comprehensive: Every version should have an entry.

•  Categorized: Group similar types of changes together.

•  Linkable: Versions and sections should be easily linkable.

•  Chronological: The latest version appears first.

•  Dated: Each version's release date is displayed.

•  Versioning: Indicate if Semantic Versioning is followed.

Instructions
Add changelog entries to the Unreleased section under the appropriate category. Each entry must include a tag and the GitHub PR reference in the following format:

* #<PR-number> message

•  Tag: Indicates where the change is made (e.g., (core), (ui)).

•  Issue Number: Will be linked during the release process, no need to manually add links.

Change Categories
•  New Features: For newly added features.

•  Enhancements: For improvements in existing functionality.

•  Deprecations: For features that will be removed in the future.

•  Fixes: For bug fixes.

•  Breaking Changes: For changes that break backward compatibility.
